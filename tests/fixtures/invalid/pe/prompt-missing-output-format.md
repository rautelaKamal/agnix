## Task Description

You are tasked with analyzing code and finding bugs. Look through the entire codebase and identify potential issues. Consider edge cases, race conditions, and error handling problems.

## Context

## Requirements

- Find all potential security vulnerabilities
- Identify any race conditions
- Check error handling coverage
- Review input validation
- Look for memory leaks

## Constraints

- Do not modify any code
- Report findings in order of severity
- Include code snippets showing the issue

This prompt is over 200 tokens but has no output format section.
