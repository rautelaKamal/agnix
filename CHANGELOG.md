# Changelog

All notable changes to agnix will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for instruction filename variants:
  - CLAUDE.local.md - Claude Code local instructions (not synced to cloud)
  - AGENTS.local.md - Codex CLI/OpenCode local instructions
  - AGENTS.override.md - Codex CLI override file for workspace-specific rules
  - All variants are validated with the same rules as their base files

### Security
- Hardened file reading with symlink rejection and size limits:
  - Added `FileSymlink` error to reject symlinks (prevents path traversal)
  - Added `FileTooBig` error for files exceeding 1 MiB (prevents DoS)

  - Applied to validation, imports, fixes, and config loading
  - Cross-platform tests for Unix and Windows symlink handling

  - Skips external URLs (http://, https://, mailto:, etc.)
  - 4 test fixtures in tests/fixtures/refs/ directory
  - 31 comprehensive unit tests for reference validation

### Fixed
- Exclude glob patterns now match correctly when validate_project() is called with absolute paths (#67)
  - Patterns like `target/**` previously failed to match when walker yielded absolute paths
  - Added path normalization by stripping base path prefix before glob matching
- PE-001 through PE-004 rules now properly dispatch on CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files (PromptValidator was implemented but not registered in ValidatorRegistry)

### Changed
- Downgraded 5 rules from ERROR to WARNING severity based on RFC 2119 audit:
  - PE-001 (Lost in the middle): Research-based recommendation, not spec violation
  - PE-002 (Chain-of-thought on simple task): Best practice advice, not requirement
  - CC-MEM-004 (Invalid command reference): Helpful validation, not breaking error
  - AGM-003 (Character limit): Uses SHOULD in documentation (Windsurf-specific)
  - AGM-005 (Platform-specific features): Uses SHOULD in documentation
- Imports validator now routes diagnostics by file type:
  - CLAUDE.md files emit CC-MEM-001/002/003 (Claude Code memory rules)
  - Non-CLAUDE markdown files emit REF-001 (generic reference validation)
  - Improved security with path traversal protection (rejects absolute paths)
  - Fixed critical bug: file type now determined per-file during recursion
- XML validator now emits specific rule IDs for each error type:
  - XML-001: Unclosed XML tag
  - XML-002: Mismatched closing tag
  - XML-003: Unmatched closing tag
- Individual XML rules can now be disabled via `disabled_rules` config
- Test fixtures restructured for improved validator integration:
  - Skills: Moved to subdirectory pattern (deep-reference/SKILL.md, missing-frontmatter/SKILL.md, windows-path/SKILL.md)
  - MCP: Renamed with .mcp.json suffix for proper FileType detection
  - Ensures validate_project() correctly identifies fixture types during integration tests
- `validate_project()` now processes files in parallel while maintaining deterministic output
- Directory walking remains sequential, only validation is parallelized
- All validators now respect config-based category toggles and disabled rules
- Config structure enhanced with category-based toggles (legacy flags still supported)
- Knowledge base docs refreshed (rule counts, AGENTS.md support tiers, Cursor rules)
- Fixture layout aligned with detector paths to ensure validators exercise fixtures directly
- CC-HK-010 timeout thresholds now align with official Claude Code documentation
  - Command hooks: warn when timeout > 600s (10-minute default)
  - Prompt hooks: warn when timeout > 30s (30-second default)

### Performance
- Significant speed improvements on projects with many files
- Maintains correctness with deterministic sorting of results
