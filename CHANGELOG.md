## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Config-based rule filtering with category toggles (skills, hooks, agents, memory, plugins, xml, imports)
- Target tool filtering - CC-* rules automatically disabled for non-Claude Code targets (Cursor, Codex)
- Individual rule disabling via `disabled_rules` config list
- `is_rule_enabled()` method with category and target awareness
- AgentValidator implementation with 6 validation rules (CC-AG-001 to CC-AG-006)
  - CC-AG-001: Validates required 'name' field in agent frontmatter
  - CC-AG-002: Validates required 'description' field in agent frontmatter
  - CC-AG-003: Validates model values (sonnet, opus, haiku, inherit)
  - CC-AG-004: Validates permissionMode values (default, acceptEdits, dontAsk, bypassPermissions, plan)
  - CC-AG-005: Validates referenced skills exist at .claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md
  - CC-AG-006: Detects conflicts between 'tools' and 'disallowedTools' arrays
- Path traversal security protection for skill name validation
- 44 comprehensive tests for agent validation (152 total tests)
- 7 test fixtures in tests/fixtures/agents/ directory
- Parallel file validation using rayon for improved performance on large projects
- Deterministic diagnostic output with sorting by severity and file path
- Comprehensive tests for parallel validation edge cases

### Changed
- `validate_project()` now processes files in parallel while maintaining deterministic output
- Directory walking remains sequential, only validation is parallelized
- All validators now respect config-based category toggles and disabled rules
- Config structure enhanced with category-based toggles (legacy flags still supported)

### Performance
- Significant speed improvements on projects with many files
- Maintains correctness with deterministic sorting of results
