## [Unreleased]

### Added
- SARIF 2.1.0 output format with `--format sarif` CLI option for CI/CD integration
  - Full SARIF 2.1.0 specification compliance with JSON schema validation
  - Includes all 80 validation rules in driver.rules with help URIs
  - Supports GitHub Code Scanning and other SARIF-compatible tools
  - Proper exit codes for CI workflows (errors exit 1)
  - Path normalization for cross-platform compatibility
  - 8 comprehensive integration tests for SARIF output
- Comprehensive CI workflow with format check, clippy, machete, and test matrix (3 OS x 2 Rust versions)
- Security scanning workflow with CodeQL analysis and cargo-audit (runs on push, PR, and weekly schedule)
- Changelog validation workflow to ensure CHANGELOG.md is updated in PRs
- PluginValidator implementation with 5 validation rules (CC-PL-001 to CC-PL-005)
  - CC-PL-001: Validates plugin.json is in .claude-plugin/ directory
  - CC-PL-002: Detects misplaced components (skills/agents/hooks) inside .claude-plugin/
  - CC-PL-003: Validates version uses semver format (X.Y.Z)
  - CC-PL-004: Validates required fields (name, description, version)
  - CC-PL-005: Validates name field is not empty
- Path traversal protection with MAX_TRAVERSAL_DEPTH limit
- 47 comprehensive tests for plugin validation (234 total tests)
- 4 test fixtures in tests/fixtures/plugins/ directory
- Auto-fix infrastructure with CLI flags:
  - `--fix`: Apply automatic fixes to detected issues
  - `--dry-run`: Preview fixes without modifying files
  - `--fix-safe`: Only apply high-certainty (safe) fixes
- `Fix` struct with `FixKind` enum (Replace, Insert, Delete) in diagnostics
- `apply_fixes()` function to process and apply fixes to files
- Diagnostics now include `[fixable]` marker in output for issues with available fixes
- Hint message in CLI output when fixable issues are detected
- Config-based rule filtering with category toggles (skills, hooks, agents, memory, plugins, xml, imports)
- Target tool filtering - CC-* rules automatically disabled for non-Claude Code targets (Cursor, Codex)
- Individual rule disabling via `disabled_rules` config list
- `is_rule_enabled()` method with category and target awareness
- AgentValidator implementation with 6 validation rules (CC-AG-001 to CC-AG-006)
  - CC-AG-001: Validates required 'name' field in agent frontmatter
  - CC-AG-002: Validates required 'description' field in agent frontmatter
  - CC-AG-003: Validates model values (sonnet, opus, haiku, inherit)
  - CC-AG-004: Validates permissionMode values (default, acceptEdits, dontAsk, bypassPermissions, plan)
  - CC-AG-005: Validates referenced skills exist at .claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md
  - CC-AG-006: Detects conflicts between 'tools' and 'disallowedTools' arrays
- Path traversal security protection for skill name validation
- 44 comprehensive tests for agent validation (152 total tests)
- 7 test fixtures in tests/fixtures/agents/ directory
- Parallel file validation using rayon for improved performance on large projects
- Deterministic diagnostic output with sorting by severity and file path
- Comprehensive tests for parallel validation edge cases

### Changed
- `validate_project()` now processes files in parallel while maintaining deterministic output
- Directory walking remains sequential, only validation is parallelized
- All validators now respect config-based category toggles and disabled rules
- Config structure enhanced with category-based toggles (legacy flags still supported)

### Performance
- Significant speed improvements on projects with many files
- Maintains correctness with deterministic sorting of results
