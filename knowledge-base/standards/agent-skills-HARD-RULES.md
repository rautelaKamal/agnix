## Directory Structure Requirements

### Required Structure
**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

A skill MUST be a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md          # Required
```

**HARD RULE**: The skill directory MUST contain a file named exactly `SKILL.md` (uppercase, with .md extension).

**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

---

## SKILL.md File Requirements

### File Format
**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

The `SKILL.md` file MUST contain:
1. YAML frontmatter at the beginning
2. Three-dash delimiters (`---`) before and after the frontmatter
3. Markdown content after the frontmatter

**HARD RULE**: YAML frontmatter is REQUIRED. The file MUST start with `---` followed by valid YAML, then another `---`, then Markdown content.

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: A description of what this skill does.
---

# Skill instructions here
```

**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

name: pdf-processing
name: data-analysis
name: code-review
```

**Invalid examples** (WILL BREAK):
```yaml
name: PDF-Processing  # INVALID: uppercase not allowed
name: -pdf            # INVALID: cannot start with hyphen
name: pdf--processing # INVALID: consecutive hyphens not allowed
name: pdf_processing  # INVALID: underscores not allowed
name: pdf processing  # INVALID: spaces not allowed
name: anthropic-tool  # INVALID: reserved word
```

---

### `description` Field Requirements

**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

The `description` field MUST satisfy ALL of the following constraints:

#### Character Length
- **MUST** be 1-1024 characters
- Minimum: 1 character (non-empty)
- Maximum: 1024 characters

#### Content Rules

description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Invalid examples** (WILL BREAK):
```yaml
description: ""                              # INVALID: empty string
description: I can help you process PDFs     # INVALID: first person
description: You can use this to process PDFs # INVALID: second person
description: <tool>Process PDFs</tool>       # INVALID: contains XML tags
```

**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices

---

### `license` Field Requirements

**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

If provided:
- MUST be a string
- No character limit specified in spec
- Should be a license name or reference to a bundled license file

---

### `compatibility` Field Requirements

**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

If provided:
- **MUST** be 1-500 characters
- Minimum: 1 character
- Maximum: 500 characters

---

### `metadata` Field Requirements

**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

If provided:
- **MUST** be a map from string keys to string values
- Keys: MUST be strings
- Values: MUST be strings

**Valid example**:
```yaml
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
```

---

### `allowed-tools` Field Requirements

**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

If provided:
- **MUST** be a space-delimited list
- Experimental feature - support may vary

**IMPORTANT CAVEAT**:
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/skills

The `allowed-tools` frontmatter field is ONLY supported when using Claude Code CLI directly. It does NOT apply when using Skills through the SDK.

---

## File Path Requirements

### Path Separator
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices

**HARD RULE**: MUST use forward slashes (`/`) for file paths, even on Windows.

- **Valid**: `scripts/helper.py`, `reference/guide.md`
- **Invalid**: `scripts\helper.py`, `reference\guide.md`

**Anti-Pattern**: Windows-style paths (`\`) will cause errors on Unix systems.

### Reference Depth
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices

**HARD RULE**: File references MUST be one level deep from SKILL.md.

**Reason**: Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files, resulting in incomplete information.

**Valid**:
```markdown
# SKILL.md
See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
See [reference.md](reference.md)
```

**Invalid** (WILL BREAK):
```markdown
# SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md
```

---

## Size and Character Limits

### Upload Size Limits
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

- **Total upload size**: MUST be under 8MB (all files combined)

### Line Count Recommendations
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices

While not a hard breaking constraint, the specification strongly recommends:
- **SKILL.md body**: Keep under 500 lines
- **Token target**: < 5000 tokens recommended

**Note**: This is listed as a recommendation in the spec, but exceeding it may impact performance.

---

## API Integration Requirements

### Beta Headers
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

When using Skills with the Claude API, the following beta headers are REQUIRED:

```
anthropic-beta: code-execution-2025-08-25,skills-2025-10-02
```

Additional header for Files API operations:
```
anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14
```

**HARD RULE**: Skills integration REQUIRES the `code-execution-2025-08-25` beta header. Skills will NOT work without code execution enabled.

### Container Parameter Structure
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

The `container` parameter MUST have the following structure:

```json
{
  "container": {
    "skills": [
      {
        "type": "anthropic" | "custom",
        "skill_id": "string",
        "version": "string" | "latest"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Required fields in each skill object**:
- `type`: MUST be either `"anthropic"` or `"custom"`
- `skill_id`: MUST be a valid skill ID string

**Optional fields**:
- `version`: Can be specific version or `"latest"`

### Maximum Skills Per Request
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

**HARD RULE**: Maximum 8 skills per request.

```

✅ **CORRECT**: Proper delimiters
```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Does something
---

# Instructions
```

---

### 11. Upload Size Exceeds 8MB
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

❌ **BREAKS**: Total skill files exceed 8MB
```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── large-data.csv  (5 MB)
└── model.pkl       (4 MB)
# Total: 9 MB - WILL FAIL UPLOAD
```

---

### 12. More Than 8 Skills in Container
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

❌ **BREAKS**: Requesting more than 8 skills
```json
{
  "container": {
    "skills": [
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill1"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill2"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill3"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill4"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill5"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill6"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill7"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill8"},
      {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "skill9"}
      // 9 skills - WILL FAIL
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### 13. Skills Without Code Execution
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

❌ **BREAKS**: Using skills without code execution tool
```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "container": {
    "skills": [{"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx"}]
  },
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Process spreadsheet"}]
  // Missing tools array with code_execution - WILL FAIL
}
```

✅ **CORRECT**: Code execution tool must be enabled
```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "container": {
    "skills": [{"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx"}]
  },
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Process spreadsheet"}],
  "tools": [{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
}
```

---

## Validation

### Official Validation Tool
**Source**: https://agentskills.io/specification

Use the official `skills-ref` library to validate:

```bash
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```

This checks:
- YAML frontmatter validity
- All naming conventions
- Required fields presence
- Character constraints

**Repository**: https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref

---

## SDK Integration Requirements

### settingSources/setting_sources Configuration
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/skills

**HARD RULE**: Skills are NOT loaded by default in the SDK. You MUST explicitly configure `settingSources` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources` (Python) to load Skills from the filesystem.

❌ **BREAKS**: Skills won't be loaded
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Skill"]  # Missing setting_sources - SKILLS WON'T LOAD
)
```

✅ **CORRECT**: Explicit configuration required
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    setting_sources=["user", "project"],  # REQUIRED
    allowed_tools=["Skill"]
)
```

### Filesystem Artifact Requirement
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/skills

**HARD RULE**: Skills MUST be created as filesystem artifacts. The SDK does NOT provide a programmatic API for registering Skills.

Unlike subagents (which can be defined programmatically), Skills must exist as SKILL.md files in configured directories.

---

## Environment Constraints

### Code Execution Environment
**Source**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide

Skills run in the code execution container with these HARD limitations:

1. **No network access** - Cannot make external API calls
2. **No runtime package installation** - Only pre-installed packages available
3. **Isolated environment** - Each request gets a fresh container

**Anti-Pattern**: Assuming network access or package installation will BREAK execution.
